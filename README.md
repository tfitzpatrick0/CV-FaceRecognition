# FACE RECOGNITION
A program that uses the Viola-Jones face detection method and LBP (Local Binary Patterns) visual descriptor to detect your face. A model is then trained to recognize the correct face when referenced against our dataset. The program is able to correctly recognize faces within the dataset after training.
